/**
 * [Screen] is a fundamental layer presenting the terminal as a bitmap-like surface where you can perform
 * smaller in-memory operations to a back-buffer, effectively painting out the terminal as you'd like it,
 * and then call `refresh` to have the screen automatically apply the changes in the back-buffer to the real
 * terminal. The screen tracks what has changed in the back-buffer, but this is completely managed
 * internally and cannot be expected to know what the terminal looks like if it's being modified externally.
 * <strong>Note that</strong> more than one [Screen]s can be attached to the same backing
 * [org.codetome.zircon.api.terminal.Terminal]. If you want a [Screen] to be displayed without
 * tracking the changes use the [Screen.display] function.
