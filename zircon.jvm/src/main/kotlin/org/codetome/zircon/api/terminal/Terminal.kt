/**
 * This is the main terminal interface, at the lowest level supported. You can write your own
 * implementation of this if you want to target an exotic graphical environment (like SWT),
 * but you should probably wrap [org.codetome.zircon.internal.terminal.virtual.VirtualTerminal]
 * and delegate to it instead of implementing this interface directly.
 *
 * The normal way you interact in Java with a terminal is through the standard output (System.out)
 * and standard error (System.err) and it's usually through printing characters only.
 * This interface abstracts a terminal at a more fundamental level, expressing methods for not only printing
 * title but also changing colors, moving the cursor to new positions, enable special modifiers and get
 * notified when the terminal's size has changed.
 *
 * If you want to write an application that has a very precise control of the terminal, this is the
 * interface you should be programming against.
